# Database Design and Implementation Project (2024)
Overview:

## Goal: To design and implement a fully functional relational database for a real-world application using DB Browser for SQLite.
Key Components:

1. Relational Database:

* A relational database organizes data into tables, which can be linked—or related—based on data common to each.
* Understand the importance of relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) in structuring data effectively.
2. Normalization:

* Definition: The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
* 3NF (Third Normal Form): Ensure that:
  - Each table has a primary key.
  -  Each column is dependent on the primary key.
  - No transitive dependency exists (non-key attributes should depend only on the primary key).
* Be prepared to explain how you applied normalization in your project.
3. Schema Development:

* Schema: The structure of your database, including tables, fields (columns), data types, and relationships.
* Consider discussing how you decided on the schema design, the entities involved, and the attributes you included.
4. SQL Queries, Views, Triggers, and Stored Procedures:

* SQL Queries: Statements used to retrieve or manipulate data.
* Views: Virtual tables created to simplify complex queries.
* Triggers: Automated actions that occur in response to specific changes in the database (e.g., after an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation).
* Stored Procedures: Predefined SQL code that can be executed to perform a specific task.
* Be ready to provide examples of how you used these elements in your project.
